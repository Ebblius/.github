# Ebblius

Welcome to **Ebblius**, a learning-focused GitHub organization dedicated to exploring and recreating existing applications or building new projects from scratch. Our primary goal is to deepen our understanding of various technologies and improve our coding skills.

## About Us

- **Team Size**: Currently, we are a small team of 3 members.
- **Primary Language**: Java is our go-to language for most of our projects.
- **Other Languages**: We are open to using other languages like Python, Go, and JavaScript, depending on the project requirements.
- **Purpose**: This organization is purely for educational purposes. We are not aiming to deliver products, but to learn and grow through hands-on experience.

## What We Do

- **Project Replication**: We take existing apps or systems and try to understand how they work by recreating them. This helps us learn best practices and explore different aspects of software development.
- **Original Projects**: In addition to replication, we also work on original projects, challenging ourselves to solve problems and innovate from scratch.

## Disclaimer

Ebblius is an educational initiative. Our projects are not intended for production use, and we do not guarantee the stability, security, or completeness of the code. Our primary focus is on learning and experimentation.

## Get Involved

If you're interested in learning with us or want to contribute, feel free to explore our repositories. We are open to collaboration and new ideas that align with our learning objectives.

Happy coding!
